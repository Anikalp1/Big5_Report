        Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and
        sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared to closed people, more
        aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic
        and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness
        to Experience; consequently, this factor has also been called Culture or
        Intellect.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of
        openness to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only
        modestly related to years of education and scores on standard
        intelligent tests.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for
        thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete
        experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual
        abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical,
        logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of
        language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or
        performing arts.
        <br />
        <br />
        People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow,
        common interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious
        over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and
        sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no
        practical use. Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are
        conservative and resistant to change.
        <br />
        <br />
        Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by
        psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However,
        open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments.
        The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well,
        but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job
        performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your score on Openness to Experience is high, indicating you enjoy
        novelty, variety, and change. You are curious, imaginative, and
        creative.

        paragraph="High scorers on this scale love beauty, both in art and in nature. They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic and natural events. They are not necessarily artistically trained nor talented, although many will be. The defining features of this scale are interest in, and appreciation of natural and artificial beauty. Low scorers lack aesthetic sensitivity and interest in the arts.

        paragraph="High scorers on adventurousness are eager to try new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different things. They find familiarity and routine boring, and will take a new route home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel uncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines.

        title="Intellect"
        score="16 (high)
        "
        paragraph="Intellect and artistic interests are the two most important, central aspects of openness to experience. High scorers on Intellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles, and brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a waste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence. Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although high scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect individuals on standardized intelligence tests.

        title="Liberalism"
        score="15 (high)
        "
        paragraph="Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to challenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most extreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright hostility toward rules, sympathy for law-breakers, and love of ambiguity, chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly incline individuals toward certain political parties.
